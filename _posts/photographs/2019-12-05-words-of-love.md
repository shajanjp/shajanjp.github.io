description: "Thank you for buying me a soldering-iron when I was 12 year old.
Thank you for not shouting when I cracked open the Philips VCD player just to know how things work inside.
Thank you for encouraging me when I chose engineering degree even after failing multiple times in math.
Thank you for not giving up on me when everyone else did.
Thank you for believing in me more than what others yell about me.
Thank you for giving me my space and not forcing to do things that I don't like.
Thank you for loving me so much and making me feel that I'm not alone.
This is not a confession to my girlfriend, these are the few things I am personally thankful to the people in my home. Family. ♥️"
