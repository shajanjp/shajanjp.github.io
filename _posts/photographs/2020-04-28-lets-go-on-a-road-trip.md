Take all your favorite things with you, someone you love, books, sketch pens, pets, camera, fairy lights, & every other thing that you can't live without.
Nothing more nothing less.

Start early, but do not rush. Stop often & look around. Talk to people, eat from local shops.

Walk a lot. Breathe the forest. Whistle to the mountains. Tell stories to the river. Fall in love with the rain.

Write notes & draw doodles of everything you pass by. Click the best moments. Sleep in the wild. Float yourself in dreams.

It's not all about how you started or where you reached.
End of the day, it's your story. ðŸ¥°
