description: "I'm never a good photographer nor an expert. I consider photograph as a medium to go back to the good old days in life, to show someone, to remember, and to feel a few things again. Its all about people, places, emotions, moments, laughs and memories. I don't even hunt for perfect photographs, It just reflects the way I think, my life and my surroundings. Many photos I took were inspired by others, some were created, and some were unexpected ones. Still, as I always say, every picture I take has a story in it. ü§ó‚ò∫Ô∏è"
