<p>I always like tinker with electronic projects since my childhood, I used to teardown every single electronic gadget in my house which I had access to. I have ruined some of them, but still, every failure taught me something.</p>
<p>Every weekend I try to learn and make something creative and useful. This one is no execption. I love lighting  and home automation projects. This one is an experiment to automate home and ambient lighting using NodeMCU. This can  control up to 4 devices(relays) and a neopixel strip.</p>
<p><a href="http://shajanjacob.com/easyhome" target="_blank">Here</a> is a live demo. The entire project is available <a href="https://github.com/shajanjp/easyhome" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to try, hack and feedback.</p>
