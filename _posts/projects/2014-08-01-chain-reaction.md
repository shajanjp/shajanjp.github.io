<p>Chain reaction is a popular android multiplayer board game. It's a very minimal and easy to understand strategic game. Its basically growing group of colored balls! Each player will have a unique color. ChainReaction challenges you to choose the best locations to earn points.</p>
<p>I just wanted to create a live web clone of the game to learn Javascript and CSS. Thats it.</p>
<p>Play it online <a href="http://shajanjacob.com/chain-reaction" target="_blank">here</a>. Source code is available <a href="https://github.com/shajanjp/chain-reaction.git">here</a></p>
