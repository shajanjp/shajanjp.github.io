<p>I really like playing with colors. Each color has its own meaning. Color is better medium to communicate. You know its <b>danger</b> when you see <i>red</i>, and its <b>safe and better</b> when its <i>green</i>.</p>
<p>Nalettes (Natural Color Palettes) is an initiative to collect colors from nature and keep them all in one place.</p>
