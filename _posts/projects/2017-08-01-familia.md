<p>Life is all about family and friends. It's sometimes hard to explain.</p>
<p>Being the youngest one in the family, I've seen my relatives taking care of each other. I am blessed to be born in such a huge family. I've more than 30 cousins. They really mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>I just wanted to map the persons/relations/important events in the life/contact numbers and geo-locations in a single place. So, this is actually a hobby project to do that.</p>
